# Age Estimation Project

## Project Overview

The network supermarket "Bread-Salt" is implementing a computer vision system to process photos of customers at the checkout area. 
This photo capture system aims to determine the approximate age of customers for two main purposes:
- Analyzing purchases and suggesting products that may interest customers in specific age groups.
- Monitoring cashier integrity when selling alcohol.

Your task is to build a model that can estimate the age of a person based on their photograph. You have a dataset of people's photos along with their age annotations.

## Project Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore the dataset of photographs to understand its structure and characteristics.
   - Analyze distributions of age annotations to identify any patterns or biases.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Preprocess the images for training, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation if necessary.
   - Prepare the dataset for feeding into a neural network model.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Choose an appropriate neural network architecture for age estimation from images.
   - Train the neural network on the prepared dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for regression tasks, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

5. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Consider the computational resources required for running the age estimation model in a real-time supermarket environment.
   - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when processing customer photographs.

## Instructions

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
   - Visualize sample images and age distributions.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Implement preprocessing steps to prepare the images and age annotations for training.
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Select and implement a neural network model suitable for age estimation from images.
   - Train the model on the training dataset, monitoring its performance on the validation set.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
   - Adjust hyperparameters or model architecture as necessary to improve performance.

5. **Submission and Review**:
   - Submit your completed project for review. Expect feedback within 24 hours.
   - Revise the project based on reviewer comments, if required, and resubmit until all revisions are approved.

## Conclusion

Once your model is approved by the reviewer, the project will be considered complete. Ensure thorough documentation of your process and results for future reference and potential improvements.
